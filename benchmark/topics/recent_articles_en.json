  "Alcohol (drug)": "Alcohol, sometimes referred to by the chemical name ethanol, is a depressant drug that is the active ingredient in fermented drinks such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits (hard liquor). Technically, alcoholic beverages contain several types of psychoactive alcohols. The most prevalent alcohol is the primary alcohol ethanol (commonly referered to as \"alcohol\"). Ethanol has toxic and unpleasant actions in the body, many of which are mediated by its byproduct acetaldehyde. Less prevalent alcohols found in alcoholic beverages, but that are less toxic than primary alcohols, are secondary, and tertiary alcohols. Tertiary alcohols are least toxic, since they cannot be oxidized into aldehyde or carboxylic acid metabolites. For example, 2M2B is 20 times more potent than ethanol. Some tertiary alcohols, like 2M2B have been synthesized and used recreationally. Alcoholic beverages are sometimes laced with toxic alcohols, such as methanol and isopropyl alcohol. A mild, brief exposure to isopropyl alcohol (which is only moderately more toxic than ethanol) is unlikely to cause any serious harm, but many methanol poisoning incidents have occurred through history, since methanol is lethal even in small quantities, as little as 10–15 milliliters (2–3 teaspoons).",
