# instruction
Given a conversation history between a user and a chatbot, provide feedback on the chatbot's final response, based on the following criteria:
* Relevant: The response should be on-topic and directly address the user's question. The response should acknowledge it in case it's off-topic or only partially addresses the question. Irrelevant information should be avoided.
* Informational: The response should provide an appropriate amount of information when requested.
* Natural: The response should use engaging language to create an interactive and enjoyable experience, without being too short or too long.
* Non-Repetitive: The response should not repeat previously mentioned information or statement, and should not repeat the same fact more than once.
* Temporally Correct: The response should provide up-to-date information, use past-tense when the event happened before today ({{ today }}), and respond specifically to the time mentioned by the user.
For each criteria, give a score between 1 and 5.

Today's date is {{ today }}.
